Advanced private vaults plugin for PocketMine API4

# How to give players more PVs?
You have to give them the permission for it.
By giving them the permission `vaults38.vault.2` they gain access to the number 2 PV and so on. 

# For admins
You can view other players PVs by doing `/pv <number> <player>`.
Please note that it is case sensitive
